        "When playing fantasy football, an owner will start a set of players stemming from different teams in the NFL. Every Sunday, the owner will have to follow and pay attention to different players across many different teams, which always makes for a fun Sunday. Occasionally, an owner might start two players from the same team, which is better known as \"stacking\". Two or more players can be stacked from the same team, tying some of your fantasy football score with the team's success. When you stack multiple players from one team, you are hoping that one player's big game leads to his teammate having a big game as well, which would ultimately increase your total score.\n"

With stacking, you take on more risk because if that respective NFL team plays poorly that week, then both players would have low fantasy outputs. Similar to a portfolio management, diversifying your players can reduce risk, but having multiple players from the same team can simutaneously increase your risk and score potential."

        "When utilizing the stack strategy, we should acknowledge it as a high risk, high reward gameplan. The stack strategy should predominantly be used when you are the underdog and need to score a large number of points. For example, if you are in a week where your team is projected significantly less than your opponent, it might make to stack your starters so that you get the extra boost that week. In this example, if you were to stack your QB and WR and a touchdown was thrown to your WR, you would get 6 points from your WR and 4 points from your QB, giving you a large 10 point swing in your matchup. By stacking, you are hoping that the team that your two players belong to does really well and is able to score more points than normal. When you are the underdog, it makes more sense to take on more risk in order to help your chances."

In the above heatmap, we want to focus on cells with the greatest positive correlations (more purple colored). This would indicate to us that one position's positive outcomes is more likely to increase its pair position's outcomes. A greater positive correlation between two positions would indicate they are better to stack with one another because one position's increase in fantasy points is likely to lead to the pair position's increase as well.\n"

        "*   WR1 and WR2: Positive correlation of 0.43 indicates that stacking a team's two best receivers is beneficial. We might want to start the two wide receivers from the same team and bet one one of them doing well, which would likely lead to the other receiver to do well too.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   QB1 and TE1: Positive correlation of 0.42 indicates that stacking a QB and TE is beneficial. We might want to start the same quarterback and tight end from the same team and bet on one of them doing well, which would likely lead to the other position to score more points as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although these correlations aren't very strong (not above 0.75), they can still be helpful in our decision making. These correlation numbers allow us to sway our decision making to potentially stack the WR1 | WR2 together or the QB1 | TE1 together to increase our risk, but to also increase our potential total. There isn't a strong correlation within both of these pairings, but there is enough correlation for us to at least partially benefit from these stackings. While these stackings could be beneficial to us, we can also see that there are pairings that might benefit from NOT stacking."

Although this is a rather weak correlation, it at least points us to beware of the potential situation where a QB performs poorly and hence so does his runningback and vice versa. As a suggested advice, it might be a better idea to NOT start the quarterback and runningback that are from the same team."

        "Hopefully this analysis gave you some insights to help you make decisions when deciding who you should draft and who you should start each week. Although there were no correlations that were strong (greater than 0.75 or less than -0.75), we can still take useful insights from the analysis.\n"

        "Initially, our question was **which positions should be stacked with one another in a starting lineup?** To answer this question, it is somewhat beneficial to stack the WR1 and WR2 together, along with stacking the QB1 and TE1 together. So in the case where you are unsure to draft or start a WR, go with the player that allows you to stack with another WR. Similarly, if you are unsure between two QBs or two TEs, go with the players that would allow you to stack with the same tight end or quarterback on their team. As mentioned previously, the correlations for these two pairings are rather low, but nonetheless they can be helpful. They can assist us in making lineup decisions when we need to pull off an upset and they can help us decide between two players during a draft."

        "As mentioned earlier as well, it might also be better to keep the QB and RB1 from separate teams. Although it was a low negative correlation, it at least  points us to stray away from a QB and RB1 from the same team. From a logic point of view this makes sense because a quarterback gets his points from throwing touchdowns and runningbacks get their touchdowns separately by rushing the ball. There isn't overlap like with a QB1 and TE1 where there might be a 10 point touchdown throw/catch swing. Nonetheless, feel free to start a QB1 and RB1 from the same team (at your own risk)."

        "I hope this study helped you understand the value of stacking and how you can leverage it throughout the season. Remember, if you are the underdog in a matchup, it might be worth stacking the WR1 & WR2 or the QB1 & TE1. One last point is that you usually will want to stack players from good teams. As a Patriots fan, I wouldn't recommend stacking any one from the Patriots... Nonetheless, good luck with your stacking endeavors!"
